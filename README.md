# 1. Introduction

he paper is published for CIKM 2022. The goal of the paper is to achieve better accuracies in multivarite time series anomaly detection.  Our goal was to train the model suggested in the paper 
and see the result for ourselves

## 1.1. Paper summary

Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is a hot-topic in deep learning. this paper proposes a unique idea in terms of data normalization. Rather than using static mean and variance which is done in similiar papers, This paper suggests a dynamic method of normalization in test set which increases mdel's performence overall. Combining this with spatial correlation and temporal correlation methods gives top notch performence
